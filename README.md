# <center>ESoft Crosshairs</center>
> Simple app to draw a crosshair in any game window

## Configuration
Configuration is now done using a JSON file (finally!)
So you no longer have to rebuild the application to modify the target window and crosshair design. Run the app once to generate the default `config.json` file to make things easier.

> Default `config.json`
```json
{
    "target": "FiveM", // Target Window Title
    "colour": 255,	   // Crosshair Colour (UINT)
    "thickness": 3,	   // Crosshair Thickness
    "width": 36,	   // Crosshair Width
    "height": 36	   // Crosshair Height
}
```
