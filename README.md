> Simple app to draw a crosshair in any game window

## Configuration
Configuration is now done using a JSON file (finally!)
So you no longer have to rebuild the application to modify the target window and crosshair design. Run the app once to generate the default `config.json` file to make things easier. Note: The `"target"` value doesn't need to be the full title, the app searches for titles that contain the value of `"target"` ie. `Note` should select `Notpad`

> Default `config.json`
```json
{
    "target": "FiveM",
    "colour": 255,
    "thickness": 3,
    "width": 36,
    "height": 36
}
```
